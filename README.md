# Voice-Enabled Form Demo Application

This is a Flask web application that demonstrates intelligent voice-enabled form filling using speech recognition and AI-powered text processing with real-time field highlighting and step-by-step guidance.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Web Form**: Interactive form with fields for name, email, phone, and address
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses browser's Web Speech API for real-time voice input
- **AI-Powered Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration with intelligent regex fallback
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Highlights current field and guides users through form completion
- **Real-time Field Highlighting**: Visual feedback showing which field to fill next

### Advanced Features  
- **Intelligent Email Extraction**: Converts speech patterns like "john at example dot com" to valid email format
- **Flexible Phone Number Processing**: Handles various phone number formats and speech variations
- **Missing Information Detection**: Automatically identifies and requests incomplete fields
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug-level logging for development and troubleshooting
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Monitor application and OpenAI API connectivity status
- **Graceful Fallback**: Seamless switch to regex extraction when OpenAI is unavailable

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Project Structure
```
speech-to-form/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main Flask application with OpenAI integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Environment variables (create from .env.example)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example          # Example environment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speech_to_form.log    # Application logs (auto-generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # Frontend with step-by-step field highlighting
```

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd speech-to-form

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your OpenAI API key (optional)
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key (optional - the app works without it):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

**Note**: If no OpenAI API key is provided, the application automatically uses intelligent regex-based extraction as a fallback.

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üé§ How to Use

### Step-by-Step Voice Form Filling
1. **Open the Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
2. **Grant Microphone Permission**: Allow the browser to access your microphone when prompted
3. **Follow Visual Guidance**: The first field (name) will be highlighted automatically
4. **Start Recording**: Click "Start Recording" and speak your information for the highlighted field
5. **Field-by-Field Progress**: After each successful extraction, the next empty field will be highlighted
6. **Complete the Form**: Continue until all fields are filled

### Example Speech Patterns
The application intelligently handles various speech patterns:

**Natural Speech Examples:**
- "My name is John Doe"
- "My email is john at example dot com" *(converts to john@example.com)*
- "Phone number is five five five one two three four five six seven"
- "I live at 123 Main Street, New York"

**Combined Information:**
- "Hi, I'm Sarah Johnson, my email is sarah at gmail dot com, phone 555-987-6543, and I live at 456 Oak Avenue, Chicago"

## üîß Technical Details

### Speech Recognition
- **Web Speech API**: Real-time continuous speech recognition
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (best), Firefox (limited)
- **Language**: English (US) with interim results
- **Error Handling**: Automatic recovery and restart on connection issues

### AI Processing Architecture
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured JSON output
- **Fallback**: Intelligent regex patterns for offline operation
- **Dual Model Support**: Falls back from GPT-4o-mini to GPT-3.5-turbo if needed
- **Smart Extraction**: Handles speech-to-text variations (e.g., "at" ‚Üí "@", "dot" ‚Üí ".")

### Form Management
- **Required Fields**: name, email, phone, address *(age field removed in latest version)*
- **Real-time Validation**: Tracks completion status for each field
- **Progressive Highlighting**: Visual guidance through form completion
- **Missing Field Detection**: Automatic prompts for incomplete information

### Enhanced Features
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug-level logging to `speech_to_form.log`
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring system status
- **Reset Functionality**: Clean form state reset with field re-highlighting
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Main application interface |
| `/process_speech` | POST | Process voice input and extract form data |
| `/reset_form` | POST | Reset form to initial state |
| `/health` | GET | System health check and OpenAI connectivity status |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Form Fields
1. Update `REQUIRED_FIELDS` dictionary in `app.py`
2. Add corresponding HTML input fields in `templates/index.html`
3. Update the field highlighting logic in JavaScript
4. Modify extraction patterns (regex or OpenAI prompt)

### Switching AI Providers
Replace the `extract_information` method in the `FormProcessor` class with your preferred AI service integration.

### Customizing Speech Patterns
Modify the regex patterns in the `_demo_extraction` method to handle your specific speech variations or language requirements.

### Styling and UI
- Modify CSS in `templates/index.html` for visual customization
- Update field highlighting styles via `.field-highlight` class
- Customize status messages and user guidance text

## üîí Security Considerations

For production deployment, implement:
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect API endpoints from abuse
- **API Key Security**: Use environment variables and secure key management
- **HTTPS**: Required for microphone access in production
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication for sensitive applications
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS attacks
- **Logging Security**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Speech Recognition Issues
- **Not Working**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- **No Permission**: Check microphone permissions in browser settings
- **HTTPS Required**: Microphone access requires HTTPS in production environments
- **Network Issues**: Check internet connection for real-time processing

### OpenAI API Issues
- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your OpenAI API key in `.env` file
- **Quota Exceeded**: Check your OpenAI account billing and usage limits
- **Model Unavailable**: App automatically falls back to GPT-3.5-turbo, then regex
- **Network Timeout**: App gracefully switches to offline regex extraction

### Form and UI Issues
- **Fields Not Highlighting**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Form Not Updating**: Verify Flask server is running and responding
- **Extraction Failures**: Review logs in `speech_to_form.log` for debugging

### Debugging Tools
- **Log Files**: Check `speech_to_form.log` for detailed processing information
- **Health Check**: Visit `/health` endpoint to verify system status
- **Browser Console**: Monitor for JavaScript errors and network issues
- **Network Tab**: Inspect API requests and responses in browser dev tools
